WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Any day could be your last in the jungle

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Get murdered on the humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The corners is the hot spot, full of, criminals

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare at the out-of-towners

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They better break north before we get the four pounders

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And take their face off the streets is real

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Undercovers, homicide chasing brothers

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The D.A.'s on the roof, trying to, watch us and lock us

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Killer coppers, comin' through in helicopters

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Thinking it can't happen til I, trap 'em and clap 'em

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And leave 'em done, won't even run about

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Nas is a rebel from the street corner

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Pulling a Tec out the dresser, police got me under pressure

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Represent, represent!

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Represent, represent!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Represent, represent!

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Represent, represent!

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Yeah, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Moet drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Life ain't shit but stress fake niggas, crab stunts

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I guzzle my Hennesey, pulling on mad blunts

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The brutalizer, buddha sizer, accelerator

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The type of brother who be pissing in your elevator

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Ayo the rap game reminds me of the crack game

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Used to sport Bally's and Gazelle's with black frames

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and Tecs

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Fly new whips, new chicks, Heine's and Beck's, I represent

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Represent, represent!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Represent, represent!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I represent y'all

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
See my, stacks are fat, this is what it's about

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I used to chill up on the corner, hold the blunt

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Every day's a different, had us running from cops

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Nowadays, I need the cash in hand, like the next man

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Fuck a yard God, let me see a hundred grand

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Could use a gun Son, but fuck being the wanted man

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
But if I hit rock bottom I'ma be the Son of Sam

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Then call the crew to get live too

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
With Swoop, Hakim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo, cooks up the blow

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Mike'll chop it, Mayo, you count the profit

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The shit is on the streets, this way the jakes'll never stop it

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly ladies and thugs

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
'Nuff respect to the projects, we ghost, One Love

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Represent ya'll, represent!

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
